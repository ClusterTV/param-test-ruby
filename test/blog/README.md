This directory contains the complete example code used in a blog post
about param_test at
http://blog.nikhaldimann.com/2013/01/23/robust-parametrized-unit-tests-in-ruby/

The easiest way to run individual test examples is via this method from:

    $ ruby -I"test/blog" test/blog/multiple_params_test.rb

(Assuming we're in the base directory of the param_test source.)
